`ssh-agent-mux` combines multiple agents' keys into a single agent, allowing
you to configure an SSH client just once. Provide all "upstream" SSH agents'
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` paths in the `ssh-agent-mux` configuration and run
`ssh-agent-mux` via your login scripts or OS's user service manager. Point your
SSH configuration at `ssh-agent-mux`'s socket, and it will offer all available
public keys from upstream agents as available for authentication.

### Added
- Add release workflow and shell script
