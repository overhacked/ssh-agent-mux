# `ssh-agent-mux` - Combine keys from multiple SSH agents into a single agent socket

Numerous types of SSH agents exist, such as the [1Password SSH agent](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/), which allows access to private keys in shared vaults, or [yubikey-agent](https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent), allowing seamless access to private keys stored on [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/) cryptography devices. The `ssh` command allows using only one agent at-a-time, requiring you to configure per-server [`IdentityAgent`](https://www.mankier.com/5/ssh_config#IdentityAgent) settings or change the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable depending on which agent you wish to use.

`ssh-agent-mux` combines multiple agents' keys into a single agent, allowing you to configure an SSH client just once. Provide all "upstream" SSH agents' `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` paths in the `ssh-agent-mux` [configuration](#configuration) and [run](#usage) `ssh-agent-mux` via your login scripts or OS's user service manager. Point your SSH configuration at `ssh-agent-mux`'s socket, and it will offer all available public keys from upstream agents as available for authentication.

## Features

* Simple TOML configuration syntax
* [systemd](https://systemd.io/) and [launchd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd) user service manager integration
* [`session-bind@openssh.com` extension](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/46e52fdae08b89264a0b23f94391c2bf637def34/PROTOCOL.agent) pass-through support for agents that support key usage constraints

## Roadmap

* Background daemon support for running directly from the command line, like OpenSSH `ssh-agent`

## Installation

### From crates.io

`ssh-agent-mux` can be installed from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ssh-agent-mux):

```console
$ cargo install ssh-agent-mux
```

The minimum supported Rust version is `1.75.0`.

### Binary releases

Download binaries for various operating systems and architectures from the [releases page](https://github.com/overhacked/ssh-agent-mux/releases).

### Build from source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/overhacked/ssh-agent-mux.git && cd ssh-agent-mux/
   ```
2. Build:
   ```console
   $ cargo build --release
   ```

   The resulting binary is located at `target/release/ssh-agent-mux`
3. (Optional) Copy the binary to another location on your machine:
   ```console
   $ mkdir -p ~/bin && cp target/release/ssh-agent-mux ~/bin/
   ```

## Usage

### Linux (systemd)

```console
$ ssh-agent-mux --install-service

$ ssh-agent-mux --restart-service
OR
$ systemctl --user enable --now ssh-agent-mux.service
```

### macOS
```console
$ ssh-agent-mux --install-service
```

Service will automatically start as soon as it is installed.

## Configuration

`ssh-agent-mux` configuration is in [TOML](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0) format. The default configuration file location is `~/.config/ssh-agent-mux/ssh-agent-mux.toml`. A simple configuration might look like:

```toml
agent_sock_paths = [
	"/Users/me/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock",
	"/Users/me/Library/Containers/com.maxgoedjen.Secretive.SecretAgent/Data/socket.ssh",
	"/Users/me/.ssh/yubikey-agent.sock",
]
```

The order of `agent_sock_paths` affects the order in which public keys are offered to an SSH server. If keys from multiple agents are listed on the server in your `authorized_keys` file, the agent listed first will be the one selected to authenticate with the server.

You can also specify all configuration on the command line, without using a configuration file at all. Any options specified on the command line override configuration file settings. To see the format of command line options, run:

```console
$ ssh-agent-mux --help
```

### Configuration file options

#### `agent_sock_paths` *[Array](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array)*

Socket paths of upstream SSH agents to combine keys from. Must be specified as absolute paths. The order of `agent_sock_paths` affects the order in which public keys are offered to an SSH server. If keys from multiple agents are listed on the server in your `authorized_keys` file, the agent listed first will be the one selected to authenticate with the server.

#### `listen_path` *[String](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#string)*

`ssh-agent-mux`'s own socket path. Your SSH client's agent socket (usually the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable or the `IdentityAgent` configuration setting) must be set to this path.

*Default*: `~/.ssh/ssh-agent-mux.sock`

#### `log_level` *[String](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#string)*

Controls the verbosity of `ssh-agent-mux`'s output. Valid values are: `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug`. For development and debugging, the [`RUST_LOG` environment variable](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging) is also supported and overrides any `log_level` setting.

*Default*: `warn`
